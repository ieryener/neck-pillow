How to Find Relief from Neck and Shoulder Pain with a Memory Foam Contour Pillow   Finding relief from neck and shoulder pain can be hard, but with a memory foam contour pillow, it may be easier than ever before. Furthermore, they don't require fluffing or tossing like regular pillows since they retain their shape over time. These feature two layers—a top layer made from visco-elastic foam that conforms to your head and neck, and a bottom layer made from supportive polyurethane foam which helps keep its shape over time. Finally, if you live in a hot climate or tend to sleep warm at night then you should make sure the model you choose has cooling gel layers included so you don’t get overheated during your slumber hours! This will ensure maximum support for your neck and also keep it from slipping out of place during sleep. The memory foam material conforms to the shape of your body as it relaxes over time, providing an even distribution of pressure across all points of contact. And thanks to its breathable material, you won't have to worry about night sweats either. <br><br>  Furthermore, unlike traditional pillows that flatten over time, memory foam retains its shape and offers more consistent comfort throughout the night. The ideal sleep experience with a memory foam contour pillow is one of pure comfort and relaxation. Additionally, avoid putting heavy items on top of the pillow that may compress its shape and reduce its life expectancy. Additionally, if the material feels too hot or cold against your skin, try adding a thin layer of breathable fabric between the memory foam and yourself. The contoured shape of the pillow helps to keep your spine in proper alignment while you sleep, reducing stress on your muscles and helping to alleviate pain from headaches, soreness, and stiff necks. A memory foam contour pillow offers many benefits that other pillows simply cannot match. <i>* Sleep Innovations</i>  How Does a Memory Foam Contour Pillow Bring Comfort and Support to Your Sleep?
