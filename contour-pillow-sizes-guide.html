<div class="mb-0 mt-2 yc5ec8965a493866ba30b647d10c75819"> <p>Traditional memory foam contour pillows are constructed with a single layer of visco-elastic foam that is designed to conform to the shape of your head and neck.  In addition to its superior comfort, the contour pillow is also hypoallergenic so it won’t cause any allergies or irritations.  Memory foam also provides excellent cushioning support for those who suffer from shoulder or back pain, as it helps keep the spine properly aligned while sleeping.  For those who prefer a softer sleeping surface, a contoured pillow with soft cushioning layers may be more suitable as it offers additional comfort while still providing firm support.  Also, because they offer greater levels of support than traditional flat-style pillows, some individuals may find them too firm for comfort when first trying them out; however this problem often goes away over time as people adjust to the new level of support provided by these unique pillows.  The contour design also keeps your head in the correct alignment with your neck, promoting proper posture while you rest.  Its ergonomic design conforms to the shape of your head and neck, providing pressure relief that helps to alleviate tension in these areas.  By taking these considerations into account before making your purchase, you can ensure that you find the best memory foam contour pillow to fit your individual needs and preferences!  With this kind of pillow, you can be sure that you're getting the best possible support for your head and neck during sleep.  <br><br>  How to Create the Perfect Sleeping Environment with a Memory Foam Contour Pillow   Creating a perfect sleeping environment is essential for getting the restful sleep your body needs.  Determine what kind of budget you have and stick with it when shopping around!  By keeping these shopping tips in mind when purchasing a contour memory foam pillow, you'll be sure to find the perfect one for all your sleeping needs!  The pillow should be thick enough to support your head without causing strain on your neck muscles or becoming too hot due to excessive compression.  If it's too soft or too hard, then consider buying a different one that meets your specifications better.  In conclusion, although there are both pros and cons associated with memory foam contour pillows – such as costliness versus longevity - overall they provide great benefits including improved neck/head posture while sleeping and enhanced cushioning which helps reduce back/shoulder pain due to poor posture during sleep.
